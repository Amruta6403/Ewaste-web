            <b>Electronic waste, or e-waste,

                refers to electronic products that
                
                have become unwanted, non-working,
                
                or obsolete, and have essentially
                
                reached the end of their useful life.
                
                As technology advances, the lifespan 
                
                of electronic devices is decreasing,
                
                leading to a growing problem of
                
                e-waste. Proper management
                
                and disposal of e-waste is crucial

       <b>Electronic waste (e-waste), is a generic term used to describe all types of old, 
        end-of-life or discarded electrical and electronic equipment, such as household appliances; 
        office information and communications equipment; entertainment and consumer electronic equipment; lighting equipment; electric and electronic tools; toys; and leisure, 
        sports and recreational equipment that are powered by electricity. E-waste contains both valuable and hazardous materials that require special handling and recycling methods.

       </b>
   
    <b>E-waste, electronic waste, e-scrap and end-of-life electronics are terms often used to describe used electronics that are nearing the end of their useful life, 
        and are discarded, donated or given to a 
        <br>
        The UN defines e-waste as any discarded products with a battery or plug,
         and features toxic and hazardous substances such as mercury, 
         that can pose severe risk to human and environmental health.</b>

    <b> E-waste comprises waste generated when end–of–life of Electronic and electrical equipment (EEE) is discarded by the user with no intent to reuse. By definition, E-Waste Management is the recycling, reuse and disposal of the waste generated by used electronic and electrical devices and appliances. 
        Therefore, e-waste management techniques are based on extracting the maximum value from whatever functional or repairable components can be separated from the waste. Examples of e-waste include old and non-functional computers and telecommunications equipment, consumer electronic devices and solar panels, fridges, TVs, monitors and screens, cooling equipment etc. 
        Some categories of E-waste, discarded by the electronics and telecommunication segment, also have many valuable metals like copper, silver, gold etc. Recycling e-waste can help reclaim these metals and prevent their loss. Some biochemical hazards like leaching are also associated with the unsafe disposal of electrical and electronic items. E-waste management techniques can prevent such chemicals and 
        heavy metals from entering landfills and, ultimately the biotic factors of the ecosystem.</b>
