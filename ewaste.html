    <center><h1>What is Ewaste ?</h1></center>
    
    <hr>
    <center><h4>E-waste	 is	 a	 popular,	 informal	 name	 for	 electronic	 products	 nearing	 the	 end	 of	 their	
        "useful	 life."	 Mobile	 Phones,	 Smart	 Phones,	 Feature	 phone,	 I	 Phones,	 Laptop,	 Desktop,
        Thin	 Clients, Air	 Conditioners,	 Televisions,	 Refrigerators,	 Washing	 Machines,	 VCDs,	
        stereos,	 copiers,	 and	 fax	 machines	 are	 common	 electronic	 products.	 Many	 of	 these	
        products	can	be	reused,	refurbished,	or	recycled.
        E-waste	has	been	one	of	 the	 fastest	growing	waste	streams	in	 the	world.	While	e-waste	
        contains	valuable	materials	such	as	aluminium,	copper,	gold,	palladium	and	silver,	it	also	
        contains	 harmful	 substances	like	 cadmium,	lead	 and	mercury.	 In	 the	 absence	 of	 proper	
        awareness,	disposing	e-waste	in	landfill	can	result	in	toxic	emissions	to	the	air,	water	and	
        soil	and	pose	a	serious	health	and	environmental	hazards.

<center><h5>Roughly 40 million metric tons of electronic waste (e-waste) are produced globally each year, and about 13 percent of that weight is recycled mostly in developing countries.
    About 9 million tons of this waste—discarded televisions, computers, cellphones, and other electronics—are produced by the European Union, according to the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP). 
   And UNEP notes that this estimate of waste is likely too low.</p

    <h5>Informal recycling markets in China, India, Pakistan, Vietnam, and the Philippines handle anywhere from 50 percent to 80 percent of this e-waste,
        often shredding, burning, and dismantling the products in “backyards.” Emissions from these recycling practices are damaging human health and the environment.</p>
   <ph5>Developing countries with rapidly growing economies handle e-waste from developed countries, and from their own internal consumers. Currently, an estimated 70 percent of e-waste handled in India is from other nations, but the UNEP estimates that between 2007 and 2020, domestic television e-waste will double, computer e-waste will increase five times, and cell phones 18 times.</h5>
   <h5>E-waste is an important global environmental and health issue. Promising policy responses have arisen from the European Union, which is defining the source as responsible for e-waste. With this approach, manufacturers are required to eliminate dangerous toxins from production.
