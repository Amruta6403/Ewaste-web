<center><h4>4. Medical Equipment:</h4></center>

      <center><h4>5. Toys Leisure and Sports Equipment:</h4></center>
      <center><h5>As kids grow older, of course, there are toys or games that they no longer use. And there must be some of those items that belong to electronics. If there is only one electronic component, such as a battery, in the toy, then it is classified as e-waste as well.

        The problems in our homes are not only in the security sector but also related to environmental issues. Garbage, which is increasing over time, has become the most common issue today.
        <br> And you see a lot about the types of electronic waste circulating.</h5></center>
